                <div class="verse">
                    <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>For all the moments never known<br> 'Cause he stepped off of the tallest sail<br> For all the love he'd left below in the waves<br> He made his peace with letting go<br> Said some things he'd never dared to say<br> The one the lighthouse left alone, never saved</p>
                </div>
                <div class="pre-chorus">
                    <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br> 'Til set of eyes had pinned him<br> Became his version of a kingdom<br> Now I know they'll never hunt me</p>
                </div>
                <div class="chorus">
                    <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br> When she's singing to me, "Glory"<br> (And a hopeful rhythm woke within him)<br> She's singing to me, "Glory"<br> (Had some letters written, 'course she's in 'em)<br> She's singing to me, "Glory"<br> (Tried to tell her, her throat wasn't in it)<br> She's singing to me, "Glory"<br> I was only ever thinking 'bout you, you know<br> She's singing to me, "Glory"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="verse">
                    <p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br> They found a letter that he wrote<br> He said, "It's best off if we burn the page"<br> I wrote it very long ago in different days<br> I guess I'm tired of talk of hope<br> I've learned that doves and ravens fly the same (Fly the same)<br> But suddenly she's all I know, an old refrain</p>
